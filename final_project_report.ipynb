Once all the data is loaded in to the notebook, a preliminary exploration is done to get familiar with the data set. Next, the data is cleaned, rearranged and formatted so it's suitable for the algorithms that will be used on the project. The wrangled data is placed in a dataframe showing the names of the neighbourhoods, the boroughs and the . A few more functions are applied to the data to get a sense of what it looks like after cleaning. It is then normalized and preprocessed. The next step involves loading the cordinates of all the boroughs and neighbourhoods in the dataframe and appending them to the dataframe.</p>\n",

So we will loop through and get all the venues in the area. To do this we will use the Foursquare API to gatehr all venues in the MAnhattan area and group them into categories. Once we get all the venues, we will aggregate the categories and form our clusters. Once we have from our aggregation and clustering,  we will see just how 'concentrated' a particular venue type is within the Manhattan area. We will also proceed to plot the clusters on the map to have a visual representation of the distribution of venues.</p>"
